              <ul id="myList">
                <li class="py-2">
                  My journey into web development began in a very different
                  field: Electrical Engineering. Initially, I started my career
                  at Infosys BPM Ltd in the Order Management Process team, where
                  I developed skills in task coordination and inter-team
                  collaboration. However, I soon realized that this role didn’t
                  align with my aspirations. I was drawn to more dynamic and
                  creative fields within the IT industry, and that curiosity led
                  me to explore opportunities in web hosting and support.
                </li>
                <li class="py-2">
                  This exploration brought me to Diya Systems, where I worked as
                  an agent specializing in web hosting technologies. In this
                  role, I provided support for customers dealing with
                  server-related website issues. It was my first hands-on
                  experience in the tech world, and I became deeply interested
                  in the inner workings of websites, server management, and
                  troubleshooting. This exposure sparked my passion for web
                  development, leading me to start learning HTML, CSS, and
                  JavaScript in my free time. It didn’t take long before I
                  realized that web development was where I wanted to focus my
                  career.
                </li>
                <li class="py-2">
                  Driven to build a professional path in web development, I
                  transitioned to a role as a Frontend Developer at Codebele.
                  This role allowed me to immerse myself fully in creating
                  interactive and responsive websites. I honed my skills in
                  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap, transforming
                  static designs into dynamic and user-friendly web pages.
                  Codebele was an incredible place to learn, but an exciting
                  change came when it was acquired by Terralogic. As a result, I
                  became a full-time employee at Terralogic, where I’ve
                  continued to develop my frontend skills and work on projects
                  that deliver high-quality, responsive web solutions for
                  clients.
                </li>
                <li class="py-2">
                  Over the last 2.5 years at Terralogic, I’ve had the
                  opportunity to work on various projects, building websites
                  that are both functional and engaging. My work has involved
                  every stage of the development process, from planning and
                  design to coding and testing. I’ve used my skills to design
                  custom email templates that support effective client
                  communication and created interactive web pages that adapt
                  seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent
                  user experience across devices.
                </li>
                <li class="py-2">
                  Recently, I began expanding my skill set by learning React, a
                  JavaScript library that brings new depth to frontend
                  development. Although I’m only six months into using React,
                  I’ve already taken on a few projects to deepen my
                  understanding and broaden my web development capabilities.
                  While I’m still relatively new to React, this transition is an
                  exciting step toward a broader technical skill set, and I’m
                  eager to continue exploring what it offers.
                </li>
                <li class="py-2">
                  As a developer, I am always looking to learn and grow. The
                  tech industry is constantly evolving, and staying up-to-date
                  with the latest tools and technologies is essential to remain
                  competitive. I regularly take online courses, attend
                  workshops, and read articles to keep my skills sharp and
                  broaden my knowledge. I also enjoy collaborating with other
                  developers, as I believe that sharing knowledge and ideas is
                  key to improving as a professional.
                </li>
                <li class="py-2">
                  Outside of work, I am passionate about building personal
                  projects that allow me to experiment with new ideas and learn
                  new skills. I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects,
                  as it allows me to collaborate with developers from all over
                  the world and give back to the community that has helped me
                  grow. These projects not only enhance my technical abilities
                  but also provide me with the opportunity to work on projects
                  that I am truly passionate about.
                </li>
                <li class="py-2">
                  In conclusion, my journey from an electrical engineer to a web
                  developer has been a rewarding one, filled with challenges and
                  opportunities to learn. My passion for technology and
                  problem-solving continues to drive me as I work on building
                  interactive and engaging web experiences. I am excited about
                  the future of web development and look forward to continuing
                  to grow as a developer, taking on new challenges, and
                  contributing to the digital world in meaningful ways.
